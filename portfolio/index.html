               <p>This project was part of teamwork with other web developers around the world.
                   The idea was to make a website via common contributions while keeping track of updates
                   and changes in the main code. </p>

                <p>Rogue Pickings was "fresh" in a few senses of the word.
                    It was both a fresh start of a web dev career, and a website for fresh 
                    food and deliveries.
