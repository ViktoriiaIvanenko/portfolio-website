                <p>I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end,<br/>
                        But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.<br/>
                        
                        <p>There was never any more inception than there is now,<br/>
                        Nor any more youth or age than there is now,<br/>
                        And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br/>
                        Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.<br/></p>
                        
                        <p>Urge and urge and urge,<br/>
                        Always the procreant urge of the world.<br/></p>
                        
                        <p>Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex,<br/>
                        Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.<br/></p>
                        
                        <p>To elaborate is no avail, learn’d and unlearn’d feel that it is so.<br/></p>
                        
                        <p>Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the beams,<br/>
                        Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,<br/>
                        I and this mystery here we stand.<br/></p>
                        
                        <p>Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.<br/></p>
                        
                        <p>Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,<br/>
                        Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.<br/></p>
